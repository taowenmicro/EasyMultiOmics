\title{Align two correlation matrices to a common variable set}
\usage{
align_corr_pair(
  A,
  B,
  mode = c("intersect", "union"),
  fill = NA,
  name_std = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A square numeric matrix with row and column names.}

\item{B}{A square numeric matrix with row and column names.}

\item{mode}{Character, either \code{"intersect"} (default) for the
intersection of variable names, or \code{"union"} for the union.}

\item{fill}{Value used to fill missing entries when \code{mode = "union"}.}

\item{name_std}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, apply \code{std_names()} to
row/column names of both matrices before alignment.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
  \item \code{[[<name_of_A>]]} Aligned version of matrix \code{A}.
  \item \code{[[<name_of_B>]]} Aligned version of matrix \code{B}.
  \item \code{$vars} Character vector of variable names used.
}
}
\description{
This function takes two square matrices (e.g. correlation matrices) and
aligns them to the same set of variables by either intersection or union of
their row/column names. The resulting matrices share identical row and
column names and ordering, making them directly comparable.
}
\details{
Optionally, a name-standardization function \code{std_names()} can be
applied to the row/column names of both matrices (e.g. to strip or normalize
IDs). This function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the package or
analysis code.

The output is a list whose first two elements are the aligned matrices,
named according to the inferred names of the input arguments (e.g.
\code{"WT"} and \code{"OE"} if you called
\code{align_corr_pair(mat[["WT"]], mat[["OE"]])}). The third element
\code{$vars} contains the variable names used.
}
\examples{
# Suppose A and B are correlation matrices over overlapping sets of taxa/metabolites:
# res <- align_corr_pair(A, B, mode = "intersect")
# names(res) might be c("WT", "OE", "vars") if A and B were passed as mat[["WT"]], mat[["OE"]].
