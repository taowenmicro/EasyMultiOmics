\title{Naive Bayes Classification of characteristic microorganisms}
\usage{
naivebayes.micro(ps = ps, top = 20, seed = 1010, k = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{A phyloseq format file used as an alternative for the input containing otu, tax, and map.}

\item{top}{The top microorganisms to consider.}

\item{seed}{The random seed for reproducibility.}

\item{k}{The number of folds for cross-validation.}
}
\value{
A list object including the following components:
\item{Accuracy}{The average accuracy of the naiveBayes model.}
\item{Importance}{A data frame showing the feature importance ranked in descending order.}
}
\description{
naiveBayes, one of the machine learning methods, was used to screen for characteristic
microorganisms, and the model was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation.

library(caret)
res = naiveBayes.micro(ps=ps, top = 20, seed = 1010, k = 5)
