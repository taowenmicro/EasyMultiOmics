\usage{
volcano.line2.omics(
  ps01 = ps01,
  ps02 = ps02,
  group1 = "micro",
  group2 = "ms",
  r.threshold = 0.6,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps01}{A `phyloseq` object containing microbiome data.}

\item{ps02}{A `phyloseq` object containing metabolomics data.}

\item{group1}{Character. Label for the first dataset (e.g., `"micro"` for microbiome).}

\item{group2}{Character. Label for the second dataset (e.g., `"ms"` for metabolomics).}

\item{r.threshold}{Numeric. Correlation coefficient threshold to include in analysis (default is 0.6).}

\item{p.threshold}{Numeric. P-value threshold for significance (default is 0.1).}

\item{method}{Character. Correlation method (`"spearman"`, `"pearson"`, etc.).}

\item{top}{Integer. Number of top features to consider for analysis (default is 500).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item Plots: Volcano plots with significant features and correlation connections.
  \item Data: Dataframes of significant features and their statistics.
  \item Edges: Dataframes of correlations between features.
