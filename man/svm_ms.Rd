\title{Svm model screening of characteristic metabolites}
\usage{
svm_ms(ps = ps, k = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{A phyloseq format file used as an alternative for the input containing metabolite composition table,
metabolite classification table, and sample metadata.}

\item{k}{The number of folds for cross-validation.}
}
\value{
A list object including the following components:
\item{AUC}{The average accuracy of the svm model.}
\item{Importance}{A data frame showing the feature importance ranked in descending order.}
}
\description{
Svm, one of the machine learning methods, was used to screen for characteristic
metabolites, and the model was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation.
}
\examples{
library(dplyr)
library(ggClusterNet)
library(caret)
library(e1071)
res <- svm_ms(ps = ps.ms \%>\% filter_OTU_ps(20), k = 5)
AUC = res[[1]]
AUC
importance = res[[2]]
