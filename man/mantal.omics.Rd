\title{Mantel Test for Multi-Omics Data}
\usage{
mantal.omics(ps01 = ps01, ps02 = ps02, method = "spearman")
}
\arguments{
\item{ps01}{A `phyloseq` object containing the first omics dataset (e.g., microbial data).}

\item{ps02}{A `phyloseq` object containing the second omics dataset (e.g., metabolomics data).}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the correlation method for the Mantel test. Options are `"spearman"` (default) or `"pearson"`.}
}
\description{
The `mantal.omics` function performs Mantel tests between two distance matrices derived from multi-omics data (e.g., microbial and metabolomics datasets). It also computes Procrustes analysis results to assess the similarity of ordination configurations between the datasets.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Computes Bray-Curtis distance matrices for the two input datasets (`ps01` and `ps02`) using the `vegan::vegdist` function.
  \item Performs Mantel tests to evaluate the correlation between the two distance matrices.
  \item Computes ordination results for both datasets using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and performs Procrustes analysis to assess similarity.
  \item Returns a summary table with Mantel and Procrustes test results for all pairwise group comparisons.
}
