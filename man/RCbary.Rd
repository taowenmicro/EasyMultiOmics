\usage{
RCbary(
  otu = NULL,
  tax = NULL,
  map = NULL,
  tree = NULL,
  ps = NULL,
  group = "Group",
  num = 99,
  thread = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{otu}{A data frame or matrix containing OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) abundance data.
Rows represent taxa, and columns represent samples.}

\item{tax}{A data frame containing taxonomic annotations for each OTU.}

\item{map}{A data frame containing sample metadata, including group information.}

\item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree object.}

\item{ps}{A `phyloseq` object containing OTU, taxonomic, and sample data.
If provided, this supersedes `otu`, `tax`, `map`, and `tree`.}

\item{group}{A character string specifying the grouping variable in the metadata. Default is `"Group"`.}

\item{num}{An integer specifying the number of null model simulations to perform. Default is `99`.}

\item{thread}{An integer specifying the number of processor threads to use for parallel computation. Default is `1`.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item `RCb`: A data frame with RCbray values for each pair of samples, including:
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the RCbray (Raup-Crick dissimilarity with Bray-Curtis distance) metric to assess ecological turnover
between microbial communities, considering both community assembly and null model simulations.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
  \item Rarefies the input OTU table to equal sequencing depth across samples.
  \item Computes the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between sample pairs.
  \item Simulates null communities based on species abundance and occurrence frequencies.
  \item Quantifies the RCbray metric as a standardized comparison between observed and null model dissimilarities.
